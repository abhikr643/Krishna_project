            <p>TEN AVATAR OF LORD VISHNU</p>

            <p>The <b>Dashavatara</b> (Sanskrit: दशावतार, daśāvatāra) are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu, a principal Hindu god. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word Dashavatara derives from daśa, meaning "ten", and avatāra, roughly equivalent to "incarnation".
            </p>
            <p>The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, particularly in respect to the inclusion of Balarama (brother of Krishna) or Gautama Buddha. 
            Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard, the "most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is Krishna, Buddha." 
            Most draw from the following set of figures, in this order: 
            <b>Matsya; Kurma; Varaha; Narasimha; Vamana; Parashurama; Rama; Krishna or Balarama; Buddha or Krishna; and Kalki.</b>
            In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces Vishnu as the source of all avatars. 
            Some traditions include a regional deity such as Vithoba or Jagannath in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha. 
            All avatars have appeared except one; Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Matsya (Sanskrit: मत्स्य, lit. fish) is the fish avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. Often described as the <b>first</b> of Vishnu's ten primary avatars, Matsya is described to have rescued the first man, Manu, from a great deluge. Matsya may be depicted as a giant fish, often golden in color, or anthropomorphically with the torso of Vishnu connected to the rear half of a fish.
            </p>
            <p>In this appearance Vishnu saved the world from a great flood. Manu, the first man, caught a little fish that grew to giant size. When the flood approached, Manu saved himself by tying his boat to the horn on the fish’s head. Some early accounts refer to the fish-saviour as Prajapati (whose identity is later merged with that of Brahma). Later sources identified him as Vishnu.</p>

                Kurma (Sanskrit: कूर्म; Kurma, 'Turtle', 'Tortoise'), is the <b>second</b> avatar of the Hindu preserver deity, Vishnu. Originating in Vedic literature such as the Yajurveda as being synonymous with the Saptarishi called Kashyapa, Kurma is most commonly associated in post-Vedic literature such as the Puranas. He prominently appears in the legend of the churning of the Ocean of Milk, referred to as the <b>Samudra Manthana</b>. Along with being synonymous with Akupara, the World-Turtle supporting the Earth.

                    Varaha (Sanskrit: वराह, Varāha) is an avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu, in the form of a wild boar. Varaha is generally listed as <b>third</b> in the Dashavatara, the ten principal avatars of Vishnu.
                Varaha is most commonly associated with the legend of lifting the earth (personified as the goddess Bhudevi) out of the cosmic ocean. When the asura Hiranyaksha stole the earth and hid her in the primordial waters, Vishnu appeared as Varaha to rescue her. Varaha slew the asura, and retrieved the earth from the ocean, lifting it on his tusks, restoring Bhudevi to her place in the universe.

                    Parashurama (Sanskrit: परशुराम, romanized: Paraśurāma, lit. 'Rama with an axe'), also referred to as Rama Jamadagnya, Rama Bhargava and Veerarama, is the <b>sixth</b> avatar among the Dashavatara of the preserver god Vishnu in Hinduism. He is believed to be one of the Chiranjeevis (Immortals), who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga to be the guru of Vishnu's tenth and last incarnation, Kalki.
                    Born to Jamadagni and Renuka, the Brahmin Parashurama was foretold to appear at a time when overwhelming evil prevailed on the earth. The Kshatriya class, with weapons and power, had begun to abuse their power, take what belonged to others by force and tyrannise people. He corrected the cosmic equilibrium by destroying the Kshatriya warriors twenty-one times. He is married to Dharani, an incarnation of Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu. He is present in the <b>Ramayana</b> due to the conflict with Rama (the protagonist of the Ramayana) over Shiva's broken bow. He is mentioned in the <b>Mahabharata</b> as the guru of Bhisma, Drona, Rukmi and Karna.

                    Rama (Sanskrit: राम, romanized: Rāma; Sanskrit: [ˈraːmɐ]) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is the <b>seventh</b> and one of the most popular avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric traditions of Hinduism, he is considered the Supreme Being.
                    Rama was born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala. His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes, such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, and challenges of ethical questions and moral dilemmas. Of all his travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds.
                    The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates dharma and dharmic living through model characters.

                    The historic Buddha (Sanskrit: बुद्ध, lit. ''the enlightened one'') or Gautama Buddha, is considered the <b>ninth</b> avatar among the ten major avatars of the god Vishnu, according to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism.

                <p>Gautam Buddha doesn’t have any power as the rest of the Vishnu avatar’s had. He was a complete human who expounded the four noble truths (Arya Satya) conceiving suffering, its cause, its destruction and the way to the elimination of sorrow.

                    In southern tradition the 9th Avatar of Lord Vishnu is considered as Balarama, brother of Lord Krishna. But in northern tradition Balaram is replaced by Buddha. According to puranas, Lord Vishnu was born as Gautam Buddha to mislead those who deny the vedic knowledge. </p>
